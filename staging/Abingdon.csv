In 1947, the arrival of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment, Harwell, brought the town of Abingdon close to the heart of the Cold War. Klaus Fuchs was living in Abingdon when he was arrested in 1950 for passing atomic secrets to the Soviet Union, as was Bruno Pontecorvo when in the same year he apparently defected to the Soviet Union causing a world-wide sensation. 
The particle physicist, Frank Close, Professor of Physics at the University of Oxford and former Head of the Theoretical Physics Division at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, has been researching Pontecorvo's 'defection' for a biography, A Life of Two Halves, and for the first time the real facts are beginning to emerge.  Pontecorvo's son, Gil, was briefly a pupil at Abingdon School and some OAs may remember him.  Professor Close will give a talk, Atomic Spies of Abingdon, based on his research, to which all OAs are invited to attend and are welcome to bring along anyone else who might be interested in the subject - especially if they can contribute anything more to the story!
